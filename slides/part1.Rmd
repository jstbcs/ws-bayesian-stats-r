# Introduction to Bayesian inference

## Example

>- Effect of media stories on attitudes towards Syrian refugees.
>- IV: Sympathetic media story about refugees or control story about food trends.
>- DV: Participants’ favorability ratings towards refugees.
>- Also recorded: Political affiliation of the participants (conservative or liberal).

<br>

<br>

Example from @Rouder:etal:2018

## Usual approach

>- Conduct a $t$-test to assess the effect of media stories on attitudes towards Syrian refugees.
>- Conduct a 2x2 ANOVA to assess the effects of both media stories and political affiliation as well as their interaction.
>- Not possible to provide evidence against these effects using classical statistics.
>- Neither necessarily match the research questions associated with the study.
>- Baysian model comparison allows to better match inference and theoretical questions.
>- But you can also do the regular stuff.

## Three main theoretical positions

>1. The plight of refugees generates an empathic response which results in an increase in favorability for conservative and liberals alike.
>2. Confirmation bias [@Tversky:Kahneman:1974]: People ignore media stories incompatible with their world view. Therefore, only liberals are affected.
>3. Belief polarization [@Cook:Lewandowsky:2016]: Liberals see refugees more favorably after viewing positive stories while conservatives might actually see them more negatively.

## Testing position 1

>- We need models

## Testing position 1

- We need models
- $\calM_1:$ The effect of media stories on attitudes is positive.

<br>

```{r, fig.asp = 0.65, fig.width=6}
par(cex = 1.2, mgp = c(2, .7, 0), mar = c(3,3,1,1))
x <- seq(-1.5, 1.5, .01)
y <- msm::dtnorm(x, 0, 0.7, lower = 0)
plot(x, y, type = "l", col = mycols[1]
     , lwd = 3, ylab = "Density", xlab = "Favorability effect"
     , ylim = c(0, 2), bty = "n")
```

## Testing position 1

- We need models
- $\calM_1:$ The effect of media stories on attitudes is positive.
- $\calM_0:$ There is no effect of media stories on attitudes.


```{r, fig.asp = 0.65, fig.width=6}
par(cex = 1.2, mgp = c(2, .7, 0), mar = c(3,3,1,1))
x <- seq(-1.5, 1.5, .01)
y <- msm::dtnorm(x, 0, 0.7, lower = 0)
plot(x, y, type = "l", col = mycols[1]
     , lwd = 3, ylab = "Density", xlab = "Favorability effect"
     , ylim = c(0, 2), bty = "n")
abline(v = 0, lwd = 3, lty = 2, col = mycols[4])
legend("topleft", legend = c(expression(M[1]: ~ "Positive effect"), expression(M[0]: ~ "No effect"))
       , lwd = 3, lty = 1:2, col = mycols[c(1, 4)], bty = "n", cex = 1)
```

## Testing position 1

>- The prior distribution indicates the plausibility of effects before the data have been collected.
>- Because we make this fine-grained specification, we can also make predictions *before* collecting any data!

```{r, fig.asp = 0.65, fig.width=6}
par(cex = 1.2, mgp = c(2, .7, 0), mar = c(3,3,1,1))
x <- seq(-1.5, 1.5, .01)
y <- msm::dtnorm(x, 0, 0.7, lower = 0)
plot(x, y, type = "l", col = mycols[1]
     , lwd = 3, ylab = "Density", xlab = "Favorability effect"
     , ylim = c(0, 2), bty = "n")
abline(v = 0, lwd = 3, lty = 2, col = mycols[4])
legend("topleft", legend = c(expression(M[1]: ~ "Positive effect"), expression(M[0]: ~ "No effect"))
       , lwd = 3, lty = 1:2, col = mycols[c(1, 4)], bty = "n", cex = 1)
```

# $t$-Test

## $t$-Test using BayesFactor

Can be used to test our position 1: The media story increases favorability ratings of refugees.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
source("R-code/generate_data.R")
media_study <- immigration_study
media_study$story <- factor(media_study$story)
# write.csv(media_study, "../data/dat_media.csv")
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula = attitude ~ story
                     , data = media_study)
```

If you want to understand formulas in R better try this [tutorial](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html#formulas-and-model-families) (for general setup) and this [tutorial](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/random_intercepts.html) (for mixed models).

## Prior settings

- $\calM_1:$ The effect of media stories on attitudes is positive.
- $\calM_0:$ There is no effect of media stories on attitudes.

>- Attitudes might be normally distributed: $Y_{ij} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu + x_j \theta, \sigma^2)$.
>- For model $\calM_0$ $\theta = 0$.
>- For model $\calM_1$ we need a prior distribution on the effect, $\theta$ 
>- Prior on $\sigma^2$ and $\mu$?

4. Informed priors ensure identifiability

## 4. Informed priors ensure identifiability

- Complex models often suffer from identifiability issues.

<img src="pics/identifiability.png" width="900" align="center">

- Informed priors introduce probabilistic constraints.

## The blessing of default priors

>- `BayesFactor` package in `R` and `JASP` use default priors for the t-test called JZS prior.
>- Prior structure is consistent.
>- Joint prior on $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ is a Jeffreys prior.
>- User-defined informed prior settings are on the scale of the effect size:
>- $\delta = \theta / \sigma$ (think Cohen's $d$).

## The blessing of default priors

- `BayesFactor` package in `R` and `JASP` use default priors for the t-test called JZS prior.
- Prior structure is consistent.
- User-defined prior settings are on the scale of the effect size.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula = attitude ~ story
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscale = 1 / sqrt(2))
```

## The blessing of default priors

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula = attitude ~ story
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscale = 1 / sqrt(2))
```

```{r, fig.asp = .7, fig.width=5.5}
par(mar = c(3,3,.5,.5), mgp = c(2,.7,0))
x <- seq(-3, 3, .01)
y <- dcauchy(x, 0, 1/sqrt(2))
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2
     , ylab = "Density", xlab = "Effect Size"
     , col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0, .5))
lines(x, dnorm(x), col = adjustcolor(1, .5), lty = 2, lwd = 2)
abline(v = c(-1, 0, 1), lwd = 0.5, col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.3))
```

## The blessing of default priors | Figure code

```{r, fig.asp = .7, fig.width=5.5, echo = T, eval = F}
par(mar = c(3,3,.5,.5), mgp = c(2,.7,0))
x <- seq(-3, 3, .01)
y <- dcauchy(x, 0, 1/sqrt(2))

abline(v = c(-1, 0, 1), lwd = 0.5, col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.3))
```

## Prior prediction

>- Prior $\rightarrow$ we can make predictions on data.
>- This is a bit tricky with the JZS prior though...

## Prior prediction

```{r sim-pred-ttest, cache = T, echo = T}
sim.pred.fun <- function(scale){
  delta <- rcauchy(1, location = 0, scale = scale)
  mu <- runif(1, -1000, 1000)
  s2 <- MCMCpack::rinvgamma(1, 0.5, 0.5)
  
  I <- 100
  cond <- rep(c(-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), each = I)
  y <- rnorm(2 * I, mu + cond * delta * sqrt(s2), sqrt(s2))
  
  return(diff(tapply(y, cond, mean)))
}

res <- replicate(100000, sim.pred.fun(1/sqrt(2)))
round(quantile(res), 2)
```

## The blessing of default priors

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula = attitude ~ story
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscale = 1 / 4)
```

```{r, fig.asp = .7, fig.width=5.5}
par(mar = c(3,3,.5,.5), mgp = c(2,.7,0))
x <- seq(-3, 3, .01)
y <- dcauchy(x, 0, 1/sqrt(2))
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2
     , ylab = "Density", xlab = "Effect Size"
     , col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0, 1.5))

abline(v = c(-1, 0, 1), lwd = 0.5, col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.3))
```

## Your turn!

1. Plot the default prior on effect size.
2. Adjust the scale until it matches your expectations of the outcome of the study. 
3. Conduct a $t$-test using your setting.
4. Do you think any two people in the workshop get the same result?

1. New data set, this time real data.
2. Run a Bayesian t-test, try out ordinal constraints and estimation, maybe even prior prediction.
3. Ask questions while I am here!

# Analysis of variance

## ANOVA

>- Based on @Rouder:etal:2012.
>- Between-subject, within-subject and mixed designs.
>- Random effects.
>- Perhaps the most thought out functionality in BayesFactor.

## ANOVA parameterization

>- Extension to $t$-test.
>- Effects are parameterized as $\delta = \theta / \sigma$ (effect size).
>- Coding is orthonormal (depends on the number of levels per factor).
>- Most simple case is two levels: $x_1 = -1/\sqrt{2}, x_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$.

## ANOVA in practice

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
media_study$story <- factor(media_study$story)
media_study$political_affiliation <- factor(media_study$political_affiliation)

BayesFactor::anovaBF(formula = attitude ~ story * political_affiliation
                     , data = media_study)
```

## ANOVA in practice

>`rscaleEffects` = A named vector of prior settings for individual factors, overriding `rscaleFixed` and `rscaleRandom.` Values are scales, names are factor names.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
BayesFactor::anovaBF(formula = attitude ~ story * political_affiliation
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscaleEffects = c("story" = 1/2
                                         , "political_affiliation" = 1/2
                                         , "story:political_affiliation" = 1/3))
```

## ANOVA in practice | Output

```{r}
media_study$story <- factor(media_study$story)
media_study$political_affiliation <- factor(media_study$political_affiliation)
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
BayesFactor::anovaBF(formula = attitude ~ story * political_affiliation
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscaleEffects = c("story" = 1/2
                                         , "political_affiliation" = 1/2
                                         , "story:political_affiliation" = 1/3))

## Prior Sensitivity

- How does your prior influence the results of the analysis?
- Redo the analysis for a **reasonable** range of priors.
- If the results are (relatively) stable then we may trust them more.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.asp = .6}
par(mgp = c(2, .7, .0), mar = c(3,3,1, .5), cex = 1.2)
p.set <- seq(.1, .6, .01)
bf <- c()
for(i in 1:length(p.set)){
  tmp <- BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula = attitude ~ story
                     , data = media_study
                     , nullInterval = c(-Inf, 0)
                     , rscale = p.set[i])
  bf[i] <- exp(tmp@bayesFactor[1,1])
}
plot(p.set, bf, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "firebrick", ylab = "Bayes factor", xlab = "Scale setting"
     , ylim = c(1, 5), main = "Media effect on attitude", bty = "n"
     )
lines(c(1/4, 1/4), c(1, bf[16]), lwd = 3, col = "slateblue")
```

## Prior Sensitivity | For two scales

Explore the range of settings using all combinations.

```{r}
a <- c(.3, .5, .7)
b <- c(.3, .5, .7)

res <- expand.grid(a, b)
colnames(res) <- letters[1:2]
knitr::kable(res)
```

## Sensitivity analysis versus multiverse analysis

>- In a multiverse analysis you draw your conclusions based on the entire space of possible parameter settings.
>- The sensitivity analysis provides information about the robustness of your analysis and conclusions, it is not meant to replace the main analysis.
>- Remember, you set the initial prior with care.

## Your turn!

1. Run the ANOVA analysis on the `dat_media.csv`.
2. Conduct a sensitivity analysis for all three prior scales using *reasonable ranges* of settings.
3. Is the variability in Bayes factor reasonable?

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
geturl <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstbcs/ws-bayesian-stats-r/
main/data/dat_media.csv"
media_study <- read.csv(geturl)
```

## Ordinal constraints

>- Not as straight-forward as with the $t$-test.
>- Not as impossible as with frequentist ANOVA.

## Back to the three main theoretical positions

1. The plight of refugees generates an empathic response which results in an increase in favorability for conservative and liberals alike.
2. Confirmation bias [@Tversky:Kahneman:1974]: People ignore media stories incompatible with their world view. Therefore, only liberals are affected.
3. Belief polarization [@Cook:Lewandowsky:2016]: Liberals see refugees more favorably after viewing positive stories while conservatives might actually see them more negatively.

## Testing position 3

$\calM_2:$ The effect of the refugee media story is positive for liberals and negative for conservatives.

```{r child = "R-code/modelcomp.Rmd", message=F, warning=F}
```

## Testing position 3

*Encompassing approach* [@Klugkist:etal:2005]:

>1. Calculate/estimate the prior probability $P(\mbox{constraint})$ for the ordinal constraint.
>2. Estimate the posterior probability $P(\mbox{constraint} | Y)$ from posterior samples of the model.
>3. The Bayes factor between the unconstrained and the ordinal-constrained model can be estimated as $$BF = \frac{P(\mbox{constraint})}{P(\mbox{constraint} | Y)}$$

## Testing position 3 | Prior probability

>- Two constraints, symmetric priors: $0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$.
>- Can also be estimated:
\[
\begin{align}
Y_{RL} &= \mu + \theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3\\
Y_{CL} &= \mu - \theta_1 + \theta_2 - \theta_3\\
Y_{RC} &= \mu + \theta_1 - \theta_2 - \theta_3\\
Y_{CC} &= \mu - \theta_1 - \theta_2 + \theta_3\\
\end{align}
\]
>- Constraints refer to $Y_{RL} - Y_{CL}$ and $Y_{RC} - Y_{CC}$, respectively.
>- \[
\begin{align}
Y_{RL} - Y_{CL} &= 2\theta_1 + 2\theta_3\\
Y_{RC} - Y_{CC} &= 2\theta_1 - 2\theta_3\\
\end{align}
\]

## Testing position 3 | Prior probability

\[
\begin{align}
Y_{RL} - Y_{CL} &= 2\theta_1 + 2\theta_3\\
Y_{RC} - Y_{CC} &= 2\theta_1 - 2\theta_3\\
\end{align}
\]

```{r echo = T}
M <- 100000
theta1 <- rcauchy(M)
theta3 <- rcauchy(M)

mean(theta1 + theta3 > 0 & theta1 - theta3 < 0)
```

## Testing position 3 | Posterior probability

```{r}
media_study$story <- factor(media_study$story)
media_study$political_affiliation <- factor(media_study$political_affiliation)
```

```{r echo = T}
tmp <- BayesFactor::anovaBF(formula = attitude ~ story * political_affiliation
                     , data = media_study
                     , rscaleEffects = c("story" = 1/2
                                         , "political_affiliation" = 1/2
                                         , "story:political_affiliation" = 1/3))

est <- BayesFactor::posterior(model = tmp
                              , iterations = 20000
                              , index = 4)
```

## Testing position 3 | Posterior probability

Reconstructing cell means and effects from the estimates.

```{r echo = T}
Y_cl <- est[, "story-Neutral"] + 
  est[, "story:political_affiliation-Neutral.&.Liberals"]

Y_rl <- est[, "story-Refugee plight"] + 
  est[, "story:political_affiliation-Refugee plight.&.Liberals"]

Y_cc <- est[, "story-Neutral"] + 
  est[, "story:political_affiliation-Neutral.&.Conservatives"]

Y_rc <- est[, "story-Refugee plight"] + 
  est[, "story:political_affiliation-Refugee plight.&.Conservatives"]
```

```{r echo = T}
(postprob <- mean(Y_rl - Y_cl > 0 & Y_rc - Y_cc < 0))
```

## Testing position 3 | Posterior probability

Bayes factor:

```{r echo = T}
(BF_u3 <- 0.25 / postprob)
```

## Testing position 3 | Posterior probability

```{r echo = T}
bftab <- tmp@bayesFactor[, 1:2]
bftab[, 1] <- exp(bftab[, 1])
bftab[5, 1] <- bftab[4, 1] / BF_u3
rownames(bftab)[5] <- "Position 3"
knitr::kable(bftab)
```

## Your turn!

- Go through the code and make sure you understand what is going on.
- Say we wanted to test whether the effect of media story is positive both for liberals and conservatives. What would change and what would stay the same?
- Implement the new constraint and report the Bayes factor for the new position 4 vs. the intercept-only model.
