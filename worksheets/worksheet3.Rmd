```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(diagram)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(reshape2)

mycols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")
```

1. Now it is your turn to conduct a "Does everyone?" analysis using `quid:::constraintBF()`. First, install and load the package. The data from the Stroop task are part of the package: `stroop`.

2. Use `quid:::constraintBF()` to conduct the analysis. Discuss and set prior scales first. Running the function may take a few minutes.

3. The output is an S4 object. You can also access individual estimates using `resStroop@individualEffects`. Try to make a plot that resembles the one below. The blue points are observed mean differences (observed effects), the red points are the estimated effects that are calculated using `resStroop@individualEffects`.

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("stroopplot.png")
```

4. If you have time conduct a prior sensitivity analysis (with reasonable settings!). Only run 2-4 analyses in total with reasonable alternative settings to yours. Should we be concerned about the robustness of the Bayes factor?
